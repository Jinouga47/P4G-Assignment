-Added Player.cpp and Player.h; these are copies of the BallSim counterparts
-Added basic movement to a rendered cube; the code resides in Game.cpp

22/03/2019
-Added new function 'Move()' in PlayerControl.cpp

23/03/2019
-Added in movement functionality in PlayerControl.cpp
-Changed 'Left' and 'Right' variable values from -0.005 and 0.005 to
 -0.002 and -0.002 respectively.
-Changed vector value for gravity; removed 0.5 modifier
-Changed 'Input' in PlayerControl.cpp to 'Input(float dTime, MouseAndKeys& input)'
-Commented out gamepad inputs from 'Input' function due to errors
-Created new boolean variable 'Airborne'; used to determine whether
 the player is in the air or not. Is used in 'Input' and 'Update'.
-Moved bounce code to 'Input'; code comes into play when conditions are met,
 not everytime the touch the groud like previously. The remaining code sets
 the player on top of the ground using the vector and sets 'Airborne' to false.
-Added If statement to set 'dTime' to 0 if the player is on the ground
-Renamed 'Move()' to 'Input()' and removed the original 'Input()'

24/03/2019
-Removed float parameter from 'Input()' in 'PlayerControl.cpp'
-Changed the vector assigned to 'mBall.GetPosition()' in
 'PlayerControl::Start()'from 0,0.5f,0 to 0,0,0
-Changed 'mVel' vector value from (0,1,0)*3 to (0,1,0)*4 in
 'PlayerControl.cpp's 'Start()' function
-Altered the 'Update()' function in 'PlayerControl.cpp'; it now takes
 two float parameters instead of one. This is so it has two dTimes for
 the jumps.
-Added If statements in 'PlayerControl.cpp's 'Input()' function to handle
 double jumping.
-Added new float variable 'mDblVel' which is used for double jumping
-Added If statements to accomodate for double jumping
-Added comments to 'PlayerControl.cpp'
-Removed 'mDblVel.y *= -1' from double jump If statement in 'Input'; this
 was causing the player to essentially fast fall to the ground instead of
 jump a second time.
-#Implemented doule jump mechanic#
-Removed 'Held'varibale and associated code; after further testing,
 it was found that it didn't actually help/isn't needed.

28/03/2019
-Uncommented code for collision and cube rendering in 'PlayerControl.cpp'
-Commented out 'COllisionManager()' in 'BallSim.cpp' to prevent errors due to previous change

#TODO#

-21/03/2019: Find out how the collision works and how to remove the hitboxes
